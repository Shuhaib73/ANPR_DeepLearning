**Beyond Object Detection: Unlocking Content Within Objects**

- Object detection has become a cornerstone of computer vision, enabling us to identify and locate objects in images and videos. However, the power of AI extends beyond simply recognizing "what's there." A crucial area within computer vision delves deeper, focusing on content recognition within objects.

**What is Content Recognition Within Objects?**

- This field takes object detection a step further by recognizing the specific information contained within the identified object. Imagine it as zooming in on a detected object and extracting its hidden details. Common techniques used here include Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text within objects like license plates, barcodes, or signs.
